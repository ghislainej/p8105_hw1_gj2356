## Problem 1

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

In the dataset `early_january-weather`, there are 358 observations that
represent hourly measurements and 15 variables :

- `origin`: weather station
- `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`: time of recording
- `temp`, `dewp`: temperature and dew point (Fahrenheit)
- `humid`: relative humidity
- `wind_dir`, `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`: wind direction (in degrees),
  wind speed and gust speed (in mph)
- `precp`: precipitation (in inches)
- `pressure`: sea level pressure (in millibars)
- `visib`: visibility (in miles)
- `time_hour`: date and hour of recording as a `POSIXct` date

The mean temperature (in Fahrenheit) is 39.5821229.

The chunk below creates a scatterplot with `time_hour` on the x-axis and
`temp` on the y-axis. The colors of the dots correspond to the humidity
(`humid`).

``` r
temp_time_plot <- ggplot(data = early_january_weather, 
                         aes( x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + 
                  geom_point() +
                  labs(y= "Temperature (in Fahrenheit)", x = "Calendar Date")
print(temp_time_plot + labs(title = "Early January Temperature and Relative Humidity",
                            colour = "Relative Humidity"))
```
