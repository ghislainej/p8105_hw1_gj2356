## Problem 1

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

In the dataset `early_january-weather`, there are 358 observations that
represent hourly measurements and 15 variables :

- `origin`: weather station
- `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`: time of recording
- `temp`, `dewp`: temperature and dew point (Fahrenheit)
- `humid`: relative humidity
- `wind_dir`, `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`: wind direction (in degrees),
  wind speed and gust speed (in mph)
- `precp`: precipitation (in inches)
- `pressure`: sea level pressure (in millibars)
- `visib`: visibility (in miles)
- `time_hour`: date and hour of recording as a `POSIXct` date

The mean temperature (in Fahrenheit) is 39.5821229 Fahrenheit.

The chunk below creates a scatterplot with `time_hour` on the x-axis and
`temp` on the y-axis. The colors of the dots correspond to the humidity
(`humid`).

``` r
temp_time_plot <- ggplot(data = early_january_weather, 
                         aes( x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + 
                  geom_point() +
                  labs(y= "Temperature (in Fahrenheit)", x = "Hourly Temperature and Date")
print(temp_time_plot + labs(title = "Early January Temperature and Relative Humidity",
                            colour = "Relative Humidity"))
```

Looking at the scatter plot, the temperature fluctuates throughout the
day as there is an oscillating pattern; however, the overall trend of
the plot shows that there is a positive linear relationship between
temperature and date. It appears to be getting warmer on average as
January progresses. It also appears that low temperatures are typically
associated with lower relative humidity and as the month progresses and
the temperature rises, so does the relative humidity.

``` r
ggsave("temp_time_plot.png")
```

## Problem 2

The code chunk below creates a data frame containing a sample size of 10
from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector indicating whether
elements of the sample are greater than 0, a character vector of length
10, and a factor vector of length 10 with 3 different factor “levels”.

``` r
hw1_q2_df <- tibble(
    norm_sample = rnorm(10),
    logic_vec = norm_sample > 0,
    char_vec = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
    fac_vec = factor(c("apples","oranges","pears","apples","oranges","pears","apples","oranges","pears","apples"),
                     levels = c("apples","oranges","pears") )
)

head(hw1_q2_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 4
    ##   norm_sample logic_vec char_vec fac_vec
    ##         <dbl> <lgl>     <chr>    <fct>  
    ## 1      0.641  TRUE      a        apples 
    ## 2     -0.715  FALSE     b        oranges
    ## 3     -0.204  FALSE     c        pears  
    ## 4     -0.717  FALSE     d        apples 
    ## 5      0.640  TRUE      e        oranges
    ## 6     -0.0955 FALSE     f        pears

The code chunk below attempts to take the mean of each variable in
`hw1_q2_df`.

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_q2_df, var = norm_sample))
mean(pull(hw1_q2_df, var = logic_vec))
mean(pull(hw1_q2_df, var = char_vec))
mean(pull(hw1_q2_df, var = fac_vec))
```

- `norm_sample`: 0.0592922
- `logic_vec`: 0.4
- `char_vec`: NA
- `fac_vec`: NA

I was able to take the mean of `norm_sample` and `logic_vec`, but was
not able to take the mean of `char_vec` and `fac_vec`.

The code chunk below attempts to convert the character vector `char_vec`
into a numeric vector using the `as.numeric` function.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw1_q2_df, char_vec))
```

I was not able to convert the `char_vec` into a numeric vector using the
`as.numeric` function and all that was returned was NA, which explains
why R was unable to take the mean of the vector. It contains non-numeric
values.
